## Why MTSApy ##

MTSApy is a library that allows to use code of MTSA (Java) in Python.
In this project MTSApy uses the API from the Java class DCSGR1ForPython to synthesize GR1 instances using the DCS algorithm.
The code in python has to decide which action is the follow to expand, based on some heuristic.
In this case the heuristics available in this repo are:
    - Random
    - Reinforcement Learning
    - Ready Abstraction (TODO: Hacerla)
